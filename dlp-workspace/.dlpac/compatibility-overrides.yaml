# DLPaC Compatibility Overrides
# These rules are merged over module defaults by id (case-insensitive).
# - Overrides can disable a default rule via nabled: false
# - Overrides can change severity/message/suggestion/description/match
# - New org-specific rules can be added here
# Defaults are in: DLPaC/Rules/compatibility-rules.yaml
rules:
  # Example: disable or downgrade the baseline SPO/OD Encrypt rule
  # - id: encrypt_sharepoint_onedrive_unsupported
  #   enabled: false
  #   # or change severity instead of disabling:
  #   # severity: warn
  #   # message: "Org-specific exception for SPO/OD encryption."
  #   # suggestion: "Limit to Exchange in production."
  #
  # Example: add a custom org rule (replace placeholder values)
  # - id: example_custom_rule
  #   description: "Example org-specific compatibility rule"
  #   severity: warn
  #   match:
  #     actions_any_of: [ExampleAction]
  #     scopes_any_of: [Devices]
  #   message: "Example warning triggered for Devices + ExampleAction."
  #   suggestion: "Adjust action or scope to comply with org standards."
  #   enabled: true
